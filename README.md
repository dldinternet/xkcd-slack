# xkcd-slack
There's a relevant xkcd comic for everything, and now you can find it with a slash command in Slack

This project uses [Dan Zhang](https://github.com/dzhang50) and [Megan Ruthven](https://github.com/maruthven)'s API to figure out what's relevant and send back a comic. This project merely pigeonholes it into Slack
